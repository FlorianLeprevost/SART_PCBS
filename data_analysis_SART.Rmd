# Objectives
List of data wrangling and analysis to do:

- [ ] Create a dataframe with an observation per probe, including : subject number, probe number, block number, trial number, and :
  - [ ] probes results (need to be converted from key value to numbers)
  - [ ] reaction time variability in the last 8 trials
  - [ ] mean reaction time
  
- Try and reproduce Seli's results
  - [ ] bin trials by controlled (6-9) vs uncontrolled trials (1-4) of unrelated thoughts (1-4)
  - [ ] calculate 
  
- Other tests
  - [ ] Regression of reaction time variability by control * relatedness
