# SART task + data analysis
What I want to do is 
I) first to program in python (1) the SART task (2) with several levels of difficulty (3) with probe apparition depending on the last reaction times
  II) Then I want to program in R (1) the data analysis I'm going to do, ideally in a Rmarkdown document. (I'm not yet sure about how I'm going to go oin this)
